      (after Jerusalem), and the largest metropolitan area.
      It is on the Mediterranean coast, about 60 km north-west of <a href="#">Jerusalem</a> and some 100 km south of Haifa.
      The official name is Tel Aviv-Yafo , and reflects the fact that the city has grown beside (and absorbed) the ancient port city of Yafo
      to the south of the new city center, in addition to many other neighboring cities. Tel Aviv is home to most foreign embassies.

      Tel Aviv is a rapidly growing city in the midst of an exciting transition from medium-sized urban center to bustling international metropolis.
      Its booming population, energy, edginess and 24-hour life style give the city a cosmopolitan flair comparable to few other cities in this part of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tel Aviv is not really divided into districts, but rather into over 50 different neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods are really distinctive areas with different cultures (e.g. Neve Tzedek, Florentin, Ramat-Ha'Chayal), while others are simply indicating a geographical area. Tel Aviv grew mainly from the south to the north so the further you go to the north you will encounter newer buildings and wealthier communities.
